# Wine Pairer

Wine Pairer uses the Food API to take a user's search query (a dish, cuisine, or ingredient) and search the food api's databse for the best wine pairings. From the top three recommended types of wine, a user can get a list of top recommended brands of that type with basic information including price and ratings and a link to buy that wine.
