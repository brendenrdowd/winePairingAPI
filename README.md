# Wine Pairer

Wine Pairer uses the Food API to take a user's search query (a dish, cuisine, or ingredient) and search the food api's databse for the best wine pairings. 

## To Do
- [ ] CSS needs to be tightened on second API placeholder
- [ ] attach a second API (waiting on key/looking for new ones)
